The question is asking you to find all unique values in a column NUMB that form a "sandwich pattern".
ðŸ‘‰ A "sandwich pattern" means:
The same value appears at row i and row i+2
The middle row (i+1) has a different value

create TABLE NUM
(SN int,
NUMB int);
insert into NUM VALUES
(1,4),
(2,7), 
(3,4), 
(4,9), 
(5,9), 
(6,7), 
(7,9), 
(8,4);
select * from NUM;
select a.sn,a.numb,b.sn,b.numb,c.sn,c.numb
from num a 
inner JOIN
num b on a.sn=b.sn+2 and a.numb=b.numb
inner join 
num c on a.sn=c.sn+1 and a.numb != c.numb;
